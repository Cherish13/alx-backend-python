##Python - Variable Annotations

Variable annotations in Python allows you to provide type hints for variables. They are a way to indicate the expected type of a variable without affecting the runtime behaviour of the code. Variable annotations were introduced in Python 3.6 as part of the type hinting feature. 

You can annotate variable using the colon(':') followed by the hint. Here's an example:
    name: str = "John"
    age: int = 25
